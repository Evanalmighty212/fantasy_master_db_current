Shared utilities used by every Dataset 2 trait-construction module --
extracted 2026-07 when lag_join()'s logic was about to be duplicated a
second time (prior_finish_traits.py needing exactly what
prior_season_traits.py already had) and validate_columns() a fourth
time. Not a speculative abstraction -- real, exact duplication that
had already happened once and was about to happen again.
